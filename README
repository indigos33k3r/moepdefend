moepdefend - example of a monitoring/injection tool based on libmoep
====================================================================

moepdefed is an example of a monitoring and frame injection tool based on
libmoep. By default, it monitors the selected channel for cells (BSSIDs) and
active stations. Statistical information are written to /dev/shm/moepdefend.
If a defend mode is specified it starts to attack all stations/cells that are
not whitelistet.

Note that the attack mode is disabled by default at compile time. If you really
want to enable it, you should rethink what you plan to do and then find out how
to enable it on your own.


Installation
------------

To install moepdefend you can use the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

See ./configure --help for details on the available parameters. For example you
can use --prefix=DIR to specify the installation prefix or --enable-examples to
build the example programs.

If you use a git checkout you must run the following commands first:

	apt-get install autoconf-archive automake autoconf autoconf-archive autotools-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev libtool pkg-config
	autoreconf -fi

A lot of functionality of libmoep requires some patches to the
mac80211 subsystem. The patches are shipped with libmoep. For details, see the
README of libmoep.
